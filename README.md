## [Applied Natural Language Processing](https://www.adelaide.edu.au/course-outlines/110028/1/tri-1/2025)
This course examines machine learning techniques that obtain leading results on the problem of natural language processing (NLP). NLP is a critical step towards effective communication between people and machines. The course teaches how to represent words and text and use both classical and modern machine learning models and Generative AI for text understanding, prediction and generation. This will be reinforced by applying NLP tools to solve practical problems through examples, workshops and projects.
